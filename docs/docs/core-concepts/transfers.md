# Transfer Operations

oMFT's primary function is to manage file transfers between different storage systems. This page explains the transfer operations available in oMFT and how to configure them.

## Transfer Types

oMFT supports several types of transfer operations, each with different behaviors:

### Copy

The **Copy** operation copies files from the source to the destination. Files are only copied if they don't exist at the destination or if they've been modified at the source.

```
Source → Destination
```

### Sync

The **Sync** operation makes the destination identical to the source, adding, removing, and updating files as necessary.

```
Source → Destination (with deletions)
```

### Move

The **Move** operation copies files from the source to the destination and then deletes the source files after a successful transfer.

```
Source → Destination → Delete Source
```

### Bidirectional Sync

The **Bidirectional Sync** operation synchronizes files in both directions, ensuring that the newest version of each file is present in both locations.

```
Source ⟷ Destination
```

## Transfer Configuration

When creating a transfer in oMFT, you need to configure the following elements:

### Basic Configuration

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the transfer
- **Description**: Optional details about the transfer's purpose
- **Source**: The source connection and path
- **Destination**: The destination connection and path
- **Transfer Type**: Copy, Sync, Move, or Bidirectional Sync

### Advanced Options

#### File Selection

- **Include Patterns**: Patterns for files to include (e.g., `*.txt`, `data/**/*.csv`)
- **Exclude Patterns**: Patterns for files to exclude (e.g., `*.tmp`, `**/._*`)
- **Min Size**: Minimum file size to transfer
- **Max Size**: Maximum file size to transfer
- **Min Age**: Only transfer files older than this
- **Max Age**: Only transfer files newer than this

#### Transfer Behavior

- **Checksum**: Compare files using checksums instead of size/date
- **Delete Before**: Delete destination files before transferring
- **Delete During**: Delete destination files during transfer
- **Delete After**: Delete destination files not in source after transfer
- **Update Existing**: Update existing files at destination
- **Skip New**: Skip new files not present at destination
- **Skip Newer**: Skip files that are newer at the destination

#### Performance Options

- **Transfers**: Number of concurrent file transfers
- **Checkers**: Number of concurrent file checkers
- **Bandwidth Limit**: Maximum bandwidth to use in bytes/s
- **Buffer Size**: Size of transfer buffer (default: 16MB)
- **Chunk Size**: Upload chunk size for chunked uploads

## Transfer Execution

### Manual Execution

Transfers can be run on-demand:

1. Navigate to the **Scheduled Jobs** section
2. Find your job in the list
3. Click **Run Now**
4. Monitor the job progress in real-time

### Scheduled Execution

Transfers can be scheduled to run automatically:

1. Navigate to the **Scheduled Jobs** section
2. Create a new schedule linked to your transfer configuration
3. Set up the schedule using cron syntax or the schedule builder
4. The transfer will run automatically according to the schedule

## Transfer Monitoring

### Status Indicators

- **Pending**: Transfer is waiting to start
- **Running**: Transfer is in progress
- **Completed**: Transfer finished successfully
- **Failed**: Transfer encountered an error
- **Canceled**: Transfer was manually canceled

### Transfer Details

For each transfer execution, oMFT records:

- Start and end times
- Duration
- Number of files transferred
- Total bytes transferred
- Files skipped
- Errors encountered
- Detailed logs

## Transfer Logs

oMFT provides detailed logs for each transfer:

1. Navigate to **Transfer History**
2. Click on a **View Details** button on the transfer entry

The logs include information about:

- Each file transferred
- Skipped files
- Errors
- Performance metrics
- Overall transfer summary

## Troubleshooting Failed Transfers

When a transfer fails, oMFT provides information to help identify the cause:

1. Check the error message in the transfer history
2. Review the detailed logs for the specific error
3. Common issues include:
   - Permission problems
   - Network connectivity
   - Invalid credentials
   - Path not found
   - Disk space issues

## Best Practices

- **Use meaningful names** for your transfers to easily identify them
- **Start small** when testing new configurations
- **Use include/exclude patterns** to limit scope when working with large directories
- **Set appropriate concurrency** based on network conditions and system resources
- **Use checksumming** for critical data to ensure integrity
- **Set bandwidth limits** to avoid network congestion during peak hours
- **Schedule large transfers** during off-peak times
- **Use notifications** to stay informed about transfer results
- **Regularly review logs** to identify potential issues
