# Schedule Management

## Schedule Types

oMFT supports several types of schedules:

### One-Time Schedules

Run a transfer once at a specific date and time.

### Recurring Schedules

Run a transfer repeatedly according to a defined pattern:

- **Hourly**: Run every hour at a specific minute
- **Daily**: Run every day at a specific time
- **Weekly**: Run on specific days of the week
- **Monthly**: Run on specific days of the month
- **Custom**: Define a custom schedule using cron syntax

## Creating a Schedule

1. Navigate to the **Schedules** section in the sidebar
2. Click **Create New Schedule**
3. Select the transfer to schedule

## Schedule Configuration

### Basic Configuration

#### Advanced Options (Cron Syntax)

For more complex scheduling needs, you can use cron syntax:

```
┌─────────── minute (0 - 59)
│  ┌──────── hour (0 - 23)
│  │  ┌────── day of month (1 - 31)
│  │  │  ┌──── month (1 - 12)
│  │  │  │  ┌── day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
│  │  │  │  │                  
│  │  │  │  │
│  │  │  │  │
*  *  *  *  *
```

Examples:
