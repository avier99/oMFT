## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **API Token Errors**: Verify your Pushbullet API token is correct
- **No Notifications Arriving**: Check device connectivity and Pushbullet app settings
- **Rate Limiting**: Pushbullet has API rate limits; spread out notification frequency
- **Device Selection Issues**: Verify device identifiers if targeting specific devices

### Pushbullet Logs

To troubleshoot notification issues:

1. Check the oMFT logs: **Administration** > **Log Viewer** > filter for "pushbullet"
2. Review the Pushbullet account activity in your Pushbullet account

## Best Practices

- **Secure Your API Token**: Treat your Pushbullet API token as sensitive information
- **Group Related Notifications** to avoid notification fatigue
- **Include Action Links** for quick access to relevant oMFT pages
- **Set Up Multiple Notification Methods** for critical systems
