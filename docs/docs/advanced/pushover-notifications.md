### Priority Levels

Pushover supports different priority levels that oMFT uses effectively:

|----------|-------|----------------|
| -2 | Lowest | Silent transfer logs, debugging info |
| -1 | Low | Successful transfers, routine events |
| 0 | Normal | Standard notifications |
| 1 | High | Transfer failures, important alerts |
| 2 | Emergency | Critical system issues |

Note: Emergency priority (2) notifications will repeat until acknowledged by the user.

### Example Notifications
