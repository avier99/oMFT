# Authentication and Authorization

oMFT provides robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the application and its features. This page explains how to configure and manage authentication in oMFT.

## Authentication Methods

oMFT supports multiple authentication methods to secure access to the application:

### Local Authentication

The default authentication method using oMFT's built-in user database:

- **Account Lockout**: Temporarily lock accounts after failed login attempts

### OAuth/OpenID Connect

Support for modern identity providers:

- **Single Sign-On**: Integrate with SSO solutions
- **Identity Providers**: Support for popular providers (Google, Microsoft, Okta, etc.)
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Automatic Account Provisioning (COMING SOON)**: Create oMFT accounts based on SSO information

## Setting Up Authentication

### Configuring Local Authentication

Local authentication is enabled by default and requires minimal setup:
