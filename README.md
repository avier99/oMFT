```ini
# Basic configuration
SERVER_ADDRESS=:8080
DATA_DIR=/app/data
BACKUP_DIR=/app/backups
JWT_SECRET=change_this_to_a_secure_random_string
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Google OAuth configuration (optional, for built-in authentication)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Email configuration
EMAIL_ENABLED=true
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_FROM_EMAIL=gomft@example.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=oMFT
EMAIL_REPLY_TO=
EMAIL_ENABLE_TLS=true
EMAIL_REQUIRE_AUTH=true
EMAIL_USERNAME=smtp_username
EMAIL_PASSWORD=smtp_password

# Two-Factor Authentication configuration
TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_byte_encryption_key_here

# UserID and GroupID
PUID=1000
PGID=1000
```

### Configuration Options

- `SERVER_ADDRESS`: The address and port to run the server on
- `DATA_DIR`: Directory for storing application data (database and configs)
- `BACKUP_DIR`: Directory for storing database backups
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token generation
- `BASE_URL`: Base URL for generating links in emails (e.g., password reset links)
- Google OAuth configuration for built-in authentication:
  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google OAuth client ID
  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google OAuth client secret
- Email configuration settings for system notifications and password resets:
  - `EMAIL_ENABLED`: Set to `true` to enable email functionality
  - `EMAIL_HOST`: SMTP server hostname
  - `EMAIL_PORT`: SMTP server port (usually 587 for TLS, 465 for SSL, or 25 for non-secure)
  - `EMAIL_USERNAME`: Username for SMTP authentication
  - `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Password for SMTP authentication
  - `EMAIL_FROM_EMAIL`: Email address used as sender
  - `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`: Name displayed as the sender
  - `EMAIL_REPLY_TO`: Optional reply-to email address
  - `EMAIL_ENABLE_TLS`: Set to `true` to use TLS for secure email transmission
  - `EMAIL_REQUIRE_AUTH`: Set to `true` to require authentication for SMTP connections, or `false` for servers that don't need authentication

- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) configuration:
  - `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Secret key used to encrypt/decrypt TOTP secrets (for 2FA)
    - Should be exactly 32 bytes (characters) for optimal security
    - If not set, a default development key will be used (not secure for production)
    - If shorter than 32 bytes, it will be automatically padded (less secure)
    - If longer than 32 bytes, it will be truncated to 32 bytes
    - Example: `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456`


- SSL/TLS Verification Control:
  - `SKIP_SSL_VERIFY`: Set to `true` to disable SSL/TLS certificate verification for outgoing connections (e.g., webhooks, email). Use with caution, as this can expose connections to man-in-the-middle attacks. Defaults to `false` (verification enabled).
    - Example: `SKIP_SSL_VERIFY=true`
### Logging Configuration

oMFT provides configurable logging with rotation support through the following environment variables:

- `LOGS_DIR`: Directory where log files are stored (default: `./data/logs`)
- `LOG_MAX_SIZE`: Maximum size in megabytes for each log file before rotation (default: `10`)
- `LOG_MAX_BACKUPS`: Number of old log files to retain (default: `5`)
- `LOG_MAX_AGE`: Maximum number of days to retain old log files (default: `30`)
- `LOG_COMPRESS`: Whether to compress rotated log files (default: `true`)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Controls verbosity level of logging (values: `error`, `info`, `debug`, default: `info`)
  - `error`: Only show errors and critical issues
  - `info`: Show errors and general operational information (default)
  - `debug`: Show all messages including detailed debugging information

Log files contain detailed information about file transfers, job execution, and system operations, which can be useful for troubleshooting and auditing.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation

#### Overview
This implementation adds TOTP-based (Time-based One-Time Password) two-factor authentication support to the application, compatible with standard authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, and others.

#### Features
- TOTP-based authentication (RFC 6238 compliant)
- QR code setup for easy enrollment
- Backup codes for account recovery
- Rate-limited verification attempts
- Secure secret storage

#### Database Changes
The following fields have been added to the `users` table:
- `two_factor_secret`: Stores the TOTP secret key
- `two_factor_enabled`: Boolean flag indicating if 2FA is enabled
- `backup_codes`: Stores recovery backup codes

#### Setup Process
1. Navigate to `/profile/2fa/setup`
2. Scan the displayed QR code with your authenticator app
3. Enter the verification code to confirm setup
4. Save your backup codes in a secure location

#### Login Flow
1. Enter email and password as usual
2. If 2FA is enabled:
   - Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
   - Alternatively, use a backup code if you can't access your authenticator

#### Security Considerations
- The TOTP secrets are encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- You must set the `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable in production
- This key should be 32 bytes (characters) long and kept confidential
- Changing this key after users have set up 2FA will invalidate their existing 2FA configurations
- For high-security deployments, store this key in a secure vault and inject it at runtime

2. Set `EMAIL_ENABLED=true` in the email configuration section
3. Ensure the `BASE_URL` setting is configured correctly for your deployment

### Webhook Integration

oMFT can send webhook notifications to external systems when jobs complete. This allows integration with monitoring tools, chat applications, custom notification systems, or workflow automation platforms.

#### Webhook Payload Structure

Webhook notifications are sent as HTTP POST requests with a JSON payload containing detailed information about the job execution:

```json
{
  "event_type": "job_execution",
  "job_id": 123,
  "job_name": "Daily Backup",
  "config_id": 456,
  "config_name": "S3 to Local Backup",
  "status": "completed",
  "start_time": "2023-07-14T15:30:00Z",
  "end_time": "2023-07-14T15:35:42Z",
  "duration_seconds": 342,
  "bytes_transferred": 1048576,
  "files_transferred": 25,
  "history_id": 789,
  "source": {
    "type": "s3",
    "path": "my-bucket/data"
  },
  "destination": {
    "type": "local",
    "path": "/backups/data"
  }
}
```

For failed transfers, additional error information is included:

```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "error_message": "Permission denied accessing destination path"
}
```

#### Webhook Authentication

When a webhook secret is configured, oMFT signs the payload using HMAC-SHA256 and includes the signature in the `X-Hub-Signature-256` header. To verify the webhook:

1. Compute the HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body using your shared secret
2. Compare it with the value in the `X-Hub-Signature-256` header
3. Process the webhook only if the signatures match

This ensures that webhook requests are authentic and haven't been tampered with.

### Admin Tools

oMFT provides a comprehensive set of administrative tools for system management and monitoring:

#### Log Viewer

The Admin Tools panel includes an integrated log viewer with the following features:

- **Log File Browser**: View a list of all available log files in the system
- **Real-time Log Viewing**: View log file contents directly in the web interface
- **Refresh Function**: Update the log list and content with the latest information
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, readable presentation with custom scrolling
- **Dark Mode Support**: Consistent theming with the rest of the application
- **Navigation**: Easily switch between different log files

This log viewer allows administrators to:
- Monitor system activity and diagnose issues without requiring server access
- View application logs, scheduler logs, and transfer logs in one place
- Track down errors and warning messages in real-time

#### Database Management

The Admin Tools interface also includes database management capabilities:
- Create and manage database backups
- Restore from previous backups
- Download backups for safekeeping
- View system statistics
- Optimize the database with maintenance tools

## Directory Structure

oMFT uses the following directory structure:

- `/app/data`: Main application data directory
  - Contains the SQLite database (`gomft.db`)
  - Contains rclone configurations in `/app/data/configs`
  - Contains log files in `/app/data/logs`
- `/app/backups`: Database backup directory

When using Docker, you should mount volumes to these locations:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /host/path/data:/app/data         # For all application data
  - /host/path/backups:/app/backups   # For database backups
```

These paths can be customized using the environment variables `
